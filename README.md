# RapidUI ðŸ¥·
RapidUI is a modern Ruby framework that addresses linguistic complexity of designing user interfaces.


### Features
- Clean and readable code reduces cognitive load and improves developer happiness.
- CSS Framework agnostic. It can be configured to work with your existing CSS framework.
- You can integrate it with [sass-jesus]() and forget about the CSS framework complexity all-together.

### History
- Rapid UI is a spiritual successor to [GoodUI](https://github.com/realstorypro/good-ui), a UI meta-programming framework based on [SemanticUI](https://semantic-ui.com/).
- It's battle tested and has been used in production by [StoryPRO](https://www.storypro.io) for over a year.
